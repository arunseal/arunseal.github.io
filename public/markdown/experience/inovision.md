### Software Engineering Intern

- Engineered the machine learning and image processing pipelines for a dynamic, moving-line automatic paint defect detection system (in production since August 2018) at the General Motors assembly plant in Flint, Michigan.
- Region-of-Interest(ROI) images are captured and identified through an image processing system built in Python and C#.
- A cascaded system of binary classifiers built using Tensorflow, can classify these ROI images into true defects and false positives with up to 98% accuracy.
- Phase 2 also allows classification of the paint defects based on their causes - such as dirt, cratering and orange peel.
