## Rivian Automotive

_Palo Alto, California (Feb 2022 - Present)_

### Staff Software Engineer, Full-Stack, Autonomy

- Led engineering efforts to design, architect and build from scratch, the 3D annotation pipeline stack for the Autonomy team. Pipelines were designed using various AWS services (including Lambda and Batch), Argo Workflows and Python (using libraries like OpenCV, numpy and pandas) to ingest Petabytes of multi modal sensor data (LiDAR, Camera, RADAR and metadata) from vehicles. Data was validated, curated (both manually and through automated processes), preprocessed and uploaded to external vendors for annotation.
- Designed the first internal 2D annotation platform in Rivian for annotating driver face and eye features. Prototyping was done using Python and Streamlit, with the finished tool being built using Go, Typescript and React.
- Helped to develop a large scale database for storage of autonomy data using MongoDB. Data was stored at multiple granularities (drive, recording, curated sequence, image and annotation) and data analysis was made possible via integrations with Databricks.
