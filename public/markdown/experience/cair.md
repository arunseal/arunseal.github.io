### Project Trainee

- Developed a Computer Vision algorithm using C++, OpenCV and PCL for rendering a full 3D Point Cloud reconstruction of the environment for a semi-autonomous stair climbing bot, in real time.
- RGB-D(depth) images captured using an Xbox Kinect camera mounted atop the robot were aligned and reconstructed using a modified variant of Comprehensive Iterative Closest Point (CICP) algorithm implemented along with Random Sampling Consensus(RANSAC).
- Efficiency was measured using run time and Modified Hausdorff Distance to calculate correspondence between 2 point clouds.
- Real time implementation was possible through a run time of less than 20 ms with alignment errors of less than 5%.
