##### This paper aims to design a method for accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes, through comparison and application of the Iterative Closest Point(ICP) algorithm using Modified Hausdorff Distance criterion. The expected outcome is a system able to align and reconstruct geometrically precise complex 3-D models in a fast and efficient manner.
